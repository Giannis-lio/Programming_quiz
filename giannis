#Made a logging page.The logic behind is that anybody who knows the password can log in. In case of 3 wrong attempts one should not be aloud to enter the game. At a later stage each one can choose a team example red, green etc we have to figure out how many teams we are going to have in the game
print("Quiz for smart folks")
i=0
l=0
while i < 3:
    password = input(f'Please enter the password', )
    i=i+1
    if password=='CEMS':
        print("welcome CEMSIE")
        break
    else:
        print("please try again")
        l=l+1

if l==3:
    print("sorry you got the password 3 times wrong")
    #here we need to stop the loging process forcing the system for exit
